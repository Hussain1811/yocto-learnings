Don't pull latest master in meta-adit repo and then create devel branch as we don't know what changes have been done.

While giving in DBS, you need not rebase to latest master and initiate. If, there is an error, then rebase

Mismatch between sources and bitbake:

Clone meta-adit to tmp folder
Git checkout  adit_v1.0-cos_master
Do meld of adit-sdc in ur i38 meta-adit with the tmp meta-adit and incorporate those changes to i38 meta-adit
Rebase ur devel branch on top of latest adit_master
Then give bitbake.
