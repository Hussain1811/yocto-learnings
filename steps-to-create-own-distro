STEPS:

git clone -b dunfell https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky ==> dunfell is the LTS. Hence, we take that

cd poky

source oe-init-buildenv

vi conf/local.conf ==> a basic template local.conf is created once you do the source as above. Only a limited set of architectures are supported. To add for you own SOC, then a separate BSP layer like "meta-adit-rcar3" of that SOC needs to be included (All this is done by mentor guys for us). Many config options are there in the mentor provided local.conf. But, in the template version, very basic configurations are there.

Do all necessary configurations ==> stuff like machine architecture, build output etc. 

cd..

source oe-init-buildenv

bitbake core-image-minimal

Go to build dir and give "runqemu qemux86-64".
